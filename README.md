CSCI E-15 Project 4

For my final project, I decided to merge my two previous projects:

1. aSkitter - a twitter-like chat program 
2. TikTok - a pomodoro task timer
3. I also wanted to enhance the features of TikTok to add pomodoro-style forms.

I did not change any of the features in aSkitter, I simply added a link to TikTok.
The merge went quite smoothly and the transition between the two programs works.

Then I starting enhancing the features of TikTok, which proved to be challenging.
I experimented with using HTML5 local storage for the forms data, something new to me. I essentially ran out of time to complete all the features I wanted. That said, my design is fairly obvious and documented in embedded comments throughout the code. There are a number of features yet to be implemented, including but not limited to:

1. Keeping the timers running when jumping back and forth between the forms
2. A strike-out feature for activities once they are completed. 
3. Moving activities from one form to another.

Thanks,
Nina

p.s. The Follow feature on aSkitter does work, it just doesn't show you any previous messages posted prior to the time you started following the user. That is by design, to not clutter up the display with old data.
