Project 4 for CSCI E-15

This project turned out to be too ambitious.
First I merged my Project 2 (aSkitter) and Project 3 (TikTok) together into one program.
That merge went quite smoothly and the transtion between the two works well.

Then I tried to enhance the features in TikTok, which proved to be challenging.
I essentially ran out of time to completely implement the features I wanted.
That said, my design is fairly obvious and embedded in the comments throughout the code.

I did not change any of the features in aSkitter.
I did try to add forms into TikTok using the HTML local storage, which I've never used before.
I ran into some challenges there, none of which are insurmountable, if I only had more time.

Most of the Form features in TikTOk are *partially* implemented.
Many known bugs, but I wanted to get in the basic framework first.
I will continue to work through the bugs as time allows.

Thanks,
Nina

p.s. The follow feature on aSkitter does work, it just doesn't show you any previous messages posted prior to when you started following a user.  That's by design.
